## BDK - Bitcoin Dev Kit, Builder Day

The Bitcoin Dev Kit (BDK) project (https://github.com/bitcoindevkit) provides a collection of tools and libraries to make it 10x easier to build secure, feature rich bitcoin wallets for applications on any platform.

In this session you will learn how to use the BDK command line interface (CLI) tool (beginner level), or Rust library (intermediate level), to create and use a taproot descriptor based multisig wallet. You will also get an overview of all BDK features, where future development is heading, and how to get involved.
